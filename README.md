# Chile Paradox

Project Overview

Masters Thesis investigating the role of institutions and free trade agreements 
in Chile's export upgrading paradox.

## Research Question

How do Chile's domestic institutions (Rule of Law, private property rights) and 
its extensive Free Trade Agreement network interact to influence export sophistication, 
and to what extent does this combination mitigate the structural constraints imposed by 
reliance on resource-based exports?

## Methodology

The study employs a quantitative research design using:
- Dynamic panel data framework with country and time fixed effects
- Gravity models to assess trade effects 
- System GMM estimators for robustness checks 
- Synthetic Control Method for Chile-specific analysis 

## Key Variables

**Dependent Variable:**
- Economic Complexity Index (ECI) from the Atlas of Economic Complexity 

**Independent Variables:**
- Rule of Law Index (WGI) 
- International Integration Index (constructed from DESTA and GDP data) 
- Trade openness, tariffs, FDI inflows, and resource dependence 

## Data Sources

- Economic Complexity: Harvard Growth Lab's Atlas of Economic Complexity
- Institutional Quality: Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) 
- Trade Agreements: DESTA Database 
- Trade Flows: UN Comtrade
- GDP and Controls: World Bank WDI and Penn World Tables
